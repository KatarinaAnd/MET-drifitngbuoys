** SIMBA **

For now, I have only included data from the gps-dataset and the air temperature from the temperature-dataset. Because there 
is no data for the altitude or pressure for each node on the temperature chain, the temperature data array is of no use.


** WEATHER STATION **

I have enquired about the data for wind_v, but so far I have not received any response.
